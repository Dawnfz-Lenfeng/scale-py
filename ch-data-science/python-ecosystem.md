# Python Software Ecosystem
Python has become the de facto programming language for data science. {numref}`python-ecosystem-img` showcases some popular data science tools:

* NumPy for scientific array computing.
* pandas for tabular data processing.
* PyTorch and TensorFlow for neural network training and inference.
* scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM for implementing common machine learning algorithms.

Python Data Science Software Ecosystem
```

Dask, Ray, Xorbits, and mpi4py are extensions to the data science ecosystem. This book assumes that readers have some knowledge with the aforementioned software ecosystem. For a deeper understanding of these tools, readers can also refer to the following books or tutorials:

* "Python for Data Analysis" {cite}`mckinney2022python`, written by Wes McKinney (the creator of the pandas project), is an excellent introductory book on data science and serves as a beginner's guide to the pandas framework.
* "Dive into Deep Learning" {cite}`zhang2023dive` provides a interactive book with code and math to learn deep learning. It is the best practical book for getting started with deep learning.
